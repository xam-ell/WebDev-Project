CS 290 Final Project (Formation and Ideas) - Group 24
Alex Jones, Spencer Bard, Tiago Brockert
Website Idea: Our website is made for software developers and allows
users to browse useful documentation across multiple software platforms
and systems by letting users search and filter through docs. Users can also
rate the helpfulness of documentations, and pages with higher “helpfullness
ratings” will appear higher on the list.
Roles:
Alex Jones [joneale6@oregonstate.edu] (Frontend): All the HTML + CSS visual
design aspects (no JS)
Spencer Bard [bardsp@oregonstate.edu] (Backend): Sets up the database +
back end that stores docs and user helpfulness data + calculates
percentage. Also seed the different data that Role 3 gathers.
Tiago Brockert [brockert@oregonstate.edu] (Data Curator): Gathers, prepares,
and categorizes the documentation items for the site itself (title, link,
category, quick description, maybe a little icon/thumbnail). Organizes them
as a CSV for role 2. Aim for 30-40 different items.
(Integration + JS): Writes ALL
JavaScript logic. This includes: fetching docs from backend, searching,
filters, % calculation/display, yes/no buttons, and updating user after rating.
Also, combines the different contributions at the end, testing, git + repo
management, deployment
Interaction Map:
Role 1 will need to coordinate with Role 4 to coordinate adding the JS logic
to the website design.
Role 4 will need to coordinate with Role 2 to connect the JS logic with the
backend.
Role 3 will need to coordinate with Role 2 to deliver the raw doc data +
make sure they understand format.
Data To Store:
Dataset of documentation items with name, link, category, description, and
optional icon. We are also storing helpfulness ratings, total votes, and the
helpful percentage.
